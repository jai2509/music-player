Music Player
This is a simple music player website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play a playlist of songs and control the playback using play, pause, next, and previous buttons.

Installation
To use the music player, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in your web browser.

Usage
Once the music player is open in your web browser, you can use the play, pause, next, and previous buttons to control the audio playback. You can also click on the song title and artist to view more information about the current song.

To add your own songs to the playlist, simply modify the playlist array in the script.js file to include the title, artist, and file name for each song.
